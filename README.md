# CODSOFT Data Science Internship Projects

This repository contains all the projects completed as part of the CODSOFT Data Science Internship program.
Each project focuses on applying data analysis and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.


## Task 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Project Description
The goal of this project is to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning.
The dataset is highly imbalanced, which makes fraud detection a challenging classification problem.

### Key Objectives
- Detect fraudulent transactions accurately
- Handle class imbalance
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

### Workflow
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature scaling (Time, Amount)
- Handling imbalance using SMOTE
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation using Precision, Recall, and F1-score

### Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Outcome
Random Forest achieved better recall and F1-score, making it more suitable for fraud detection.


## Task 2: Titanic Survival Analysis

### Project Description
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival and understand the factors
that influenced survival during the disaster.

### Key Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Build a classification model for survival prediction

### Workflow
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation

### Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Outcome
The analysis shows that gender, passenger class, and age were key factors affecting survival.


## Task 3: IMDb Movies Data Analysis

### Project Description
This project performs exploratory data analysis on an IMDb movies dataset to identify trends
in movie ratings, genres, and release patterns.

### Key Objectives
- Analyze movie ratings and genres
- Identify trends over the years
- Perform data visualization for insights

### Workflow
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing and inconsistent values
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data visualization

### Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Outcome
The analysis highlights trends in movie ratings, popular genres, and audience preferences.
